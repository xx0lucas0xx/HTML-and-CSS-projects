	 <h2>The basics of crystals</h2>
	 <p> Crystals are solid materials that have atoms that form a specific structure and shape. 
	 The objects surfaces should also reflect its internal structure.</p>
	 <h3>How do crystals form?</h3>
	 <p>Crystals form when molecules come together and stabilize when certain liquids
	 like magma or when mineral rich water evaporates or from consistent pressure.</p>
	 <h4>How do crystals grow?</h4>
	 <p>Crystals tend to start out small and grow the more atoms are added to the structure 
	 through mineral rich water, or even water vapor!</p>
