	 <h2>The basics of crystals</h2>
		
	 <p> Crystals are solid materials that have atoms that form a specific structure and shape. 
	 The objects surfaces should also reflect its internal structure.</p> 
	 <h3>How do crystals form?</h3>
	 <p>Crystals form when molecules come together and stabilize when certain liquids
	 like magma or when mineral rich water evaporates or from consistent pressure.</p>
	 <h4>How do crystals grow?</h4>
	 <p>Crystals tend to start out small and grow the more atoms are added to the structure 
	 through mineral rich water, or even water vapor!</p>

	What Is Crystalline Structure?
 A crystalline structure is any structure of ions, molecules, or atoms that are held together in an ordered, three-dimensional arrangement.
 Crystalline structure is one of two types of structural ordering of atoms, the other being the amorphous structure.
 The key difference in the crystalline and amorphous structure is the ordering of the structure.
 Crystalline structure can be thought of as the highest level of order that can exist in a material, while an amorphous structure is irregular and lacks the repeating pattern of a crystal lattice.
